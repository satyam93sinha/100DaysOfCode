word = input()
count_z, count_o = 0, 0
for i in range(len(word)):
    if word[i]=='z':
        count_z += 1
    elif word[i] == 'o':
        count_o += 1
if 2*count_z == count_o:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
    
Second Approach:
from collections import Counter
word_counter = Counter(word)
if 2*word_counter['z'] == word_counter['o']:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
