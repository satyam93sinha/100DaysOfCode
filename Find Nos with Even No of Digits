How to compute the number of digits of a number ?
Ans: Divide the number by 10 again and again to get the number of digits.

TIME: O(n*m), where n is len(nums) and m is len(element)
Space: O(1)

class Solution:
    def findNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        even_elems = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            curr_elem, digits = nums[i], 0
            while curr_elem>0:
                digits += 1
                curr_elem = curr_elem//10
            if digits%2 == 0:
                even_elems += 1
        return even_elems
